### Layout
The layout of the website is devided into an area accessible to all and area exclusively for logged-in users. 

For better user experience and uncertainty avoidance about what the project is about, hesitance to sign up, and to able older people with little computer skills to be able to take advantage of what the platform has to offer, the website's content is visible to all. 

To contribute content and engage in conversations, the users must be logged in.
